# mycodiversity
Pipelines for analysing fungal diversity data

## repository structure
The repository is structured as followed:
- **PROFUNGIS** : Pipeline for processing raw Fungal ITS Sequences markers obtained from SRA to unique ZOTUs sequences.
- **PROFUNGIS_post_processing** : incorporation of new ZOTUs sequences into MDDB reference table "ref_sequence" and update of mapping table ZOTU reference SRA
- **ncbi_data_aquistion** : automatic pipeline for retrieving sequence read archive metadata that is associated to open source publication linked to metabarcoding studies.

## method

please read the README files for each pipeline for running the relevant pipelines.
